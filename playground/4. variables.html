<!-- 
Semi-colons at the end of each line...
 *are used to terminate a line of JS
 *a line with a semi colon at the end is referred to as a statement 
 *a Statment is an instruction the the computer/browser/js interpreter to do something
 *a variable was being delcared, a variable was being updated, a function was being called, etc.
 *any time you want to do something in JS, it's referred to as a statement and each statement ends with a semi-colon
 *ASI - automatic semi-colon insertion, you can get away without semi-colons in present dday
 *It's best to learn JS with semi-colons, but then you can decide whether or not to use them when you are ready

Code blocks
*bound by curly braces
*function definitions, if statements, loops, etc- do not need semi-colons at the end because you're just running some code and telling the computer to run something INSIDE the code block
