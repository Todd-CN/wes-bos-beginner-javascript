<!-- Objects
*Everything in JS is an object
*Objects allow us to group together keys and values (properties and values)
*Objects have many uses from storing related data, storing functionality, all the way through creating your own custom objects
*Objects are used in a way in that the order of the keys/properties does not matter
  -just because the JS interpreter orders props a certain away, don't ever rely on it to maintain it the same way every time
*Creating Objects
 -Object literal syntax {}
 -can also use new Object({}) - probably won't see this notation ever simply because the object literal syntax is much cleaner
 -when creating objects, we can just use object literal syntax
 - property : value
 - values of an object can be any data-type, can even be other objects or arrays
-You can NOT have variables with a dash in it, but you can have keys/properties with a dash in it- should try to avoid it thought
-Always put comma dangles on the end of objects if you can
*There is a gotcha around copying/cloning objects we'll reference in a bit
*Adding a property/key after the object has been created 
 -Use dot notation
 -person.job = 'Web Developer'
 -remember that const does NOT mean the value of an object cannot be changed- const means the binding to that person cannot be changed
